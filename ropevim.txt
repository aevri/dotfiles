Make sure to install ropevim as a Python module in the user context, e.g.

    pip3 install ~/.vim/plugged/ropevim/ --user

You can check that the module is available in the context of Vim like so:

    :python3 << EOF
    :import ropevim
    :EOF

If there's no error from the above, and 'ropevim_prefer_py3' is non-zero, then
it should work.
